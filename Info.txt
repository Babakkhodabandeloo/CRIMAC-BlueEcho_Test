I added you as user to the project folder, Ces-Prosjekt\16034-AquaPlan. Under EXPERIMENTS\ Herring_Experiments you find the specific times in the excel sheet Treatements_herring. In the PP in the same folder are some echograms screendumps from LSSS for the various blocks, just to get an impression of what is going on.
